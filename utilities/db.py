"""
db.py - SQLite database layer for the Site Awareness Dashboard (SAD).

This module owns the schema and provides small, dependency-free helper
functions for reading and writing discovery data. Nothing outside this
file should be writing raw SQL against sad.db - everything goes through
these functions so the schema can evolve without hunting through the
whole codebase.

Design notes (decided during planning, not obvious from the code alone):
- Every discovery-derived table carries `source` and `last_seen` so we
  always know *where* a row came from and *how fresh* it is.
- `raw_source_data` stores the original parsed line/record as text so
  we can reprocess history later if parsing logic changes, without a
  full network re-scan.
- Sources in use: 'cdp' (CDP walk discovery) and 'inventory_sync'
  (bulk import from whatever inventory tool is current - Prime,
  Catalyst Center, etc; deliberately not tool-specific since the tool
  itself is expected to change over time). 'manual' is reserved for
  a person explicitly overriding a value by hand.
- devices.mgmt_ip is a CACHED "best known IP" value, derived from
  device_ips (see below) - nothing should write to it directly other
  than _refresh_cached_mgmt_ip(). It exists as a fast/simple column
  for anything that just wants "the IP to use right now" without
  caring about ranking logic.
- device_ips holds every IP ever observed for a device, tagged with
  its own source, and is never destructively overwritten - only
  added to. This exists because CDP-reported "management addresses"
  are sometimes wrong (e.g. a router advertising an unroutable
  interface-local IP instead of its real mgmt IP), so blindly trusting
  the most recent report isn't safe. inventory_sync data
  (the org's actual system of record) always outranks cdp data when
  picking the current best IP; among same-source candidates, an IP
  whose first two octets match another known-good IP at the same site
  is preferred as a tie-breaker. See record_device_ip() and
  get_best_ip_for_device().

    What moves, table by table (every table that references
    devices(id) is covered - foreign keys are enforced, so a missed one
    would make the final delete fail and roll the whole merge back):
      - device_ips: re-parented with last_seen preserved; an IP both
        devices had keeps the higher-ranked source and newer last_seen.
        Cached mgmt_ip is recomputed afterward.
      - links: re-pointed onto the target. A link that becomes
        equivalent to one the target already has (checked in BOTH
        orientations, same as upsert_link()) is merged into it; a link
        between the duplicate and the target themselves is dropped (a
        device can't link to itself).
      - arp_entries, clients: re-pointed.
      - mac_table_raw (one row per device): the newer collection wins.
      - tunnel_interfaces: re-pointed; same interface on both keeps the
        newer. tunnel_links is DERIVED data, so rows owned by the
        duplicate are cleared and match_tunnels() rebuilds from the
        merged interfaces.
      - device_aliases: any pointing at the duplicate move to the target.
      - Target's own platform/serial_number/arp_override_ip are kept;
        only blanks are filled from the duplicate. last_seen becomes the
        newer of the two (which is what clears the "not seen" stale
        flag). The duplicate's manual stale mark is NOT carried over.
      - CDP/ARP seed flags transfer to the target if the duplicate held
        them (and the sites.seed_device/arp_seed_device hostname mirrors
        are kept in step with the final hostname).

    keep_hostname: "target" (default) keeps the target's name;
    "duplicate" renames the target to the duplicate's name. Either way
    the name that is NOT kept is recorded in device_aliases, so the next
    discovery/inventory run that reports it lands on the survivor
    instead of re-creating the duplicate.

    dry_run=True performs the exact same work and then ROLLS BACK the
    connection's open transaction, returning the same summary - so a
    preview can never disagree with the real thing. Use a dedicated
    connection for it (anything else uncommitted on the connection is
    rolled back too).

    Returns a plain-JSON summary dict (counts per table, final
    hostname, seed transfers, filled fields). Raises ValueError for a
    bad pairing; any other failure propagates and, under get_conn(),
    means nothing was committed.

    Deliberately global rather than per-site - a tunnel's far end is
    very often at a different site than the one just scanned, so this
    has to search the WHOLE tunnel_interfaces table, not just whatever
    site triggered the collection.

    Every eligible tunnel_interfaces row gets its own tunnel_links row
    (as device_a), whether or not a match was found - see
    tunnel_links' own schema comment for why a genuine pair ends up as
    two rows, one from each side, and why a one-sided tunnel is
    deliberately surfaced (device_b_id/device_b_interface left NULL)
    rather than hidden.

    Ambiguous cases (more than one row claims the exact same reverse
    source/destination pair - a real misconfiguration, not expected in
    normal operation) are left one-sided rather than guessed at, and
    counted separately so a caller can report them rather than the
    mismatch going unnoticed.

    Meant to be re-run after every tunnel collection (whether one site
    or the whole fleet) - existing tunnel_links rows are refreshed in
    place via upsert, not accumulated as history.
