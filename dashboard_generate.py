dashboard_generate.py - Generates the static HTML dashboard (index page
+ one page per site) directly from sad.db. Reuses utilities/db.py for
every query and utilities/topology_layout.py + topology_svg.py for the
per-site topology diagram - no new query or layout logic lives here,
this module is purely "fetch data, fill in HTML."

Usage:
    python3 dashboard_generate.py                  # regenerate everything
    python3 dashboard_generate.py --site <key>      # regenerate one site + the index

Run from the project root, same as orchestrator.py and gui.py.

    (see tunnel_links' schema comment for why this site's panel only
    ever shows its OWN half of a pair - the far site's own page shows
    its own row independently).

    Joined here by (device_id, interface) rather than queried as one
    combined SQL statement, since the two tables serve different
    purposes (raw collected data vs. a derived global correlation) and
    keeping them as separate db.py accessors means match_tunnels()
    re-runs don't require re-deriving anything this function already
    has cached - it just re-reads both.

    Three distinct badge states, deliberately NOT all using the same
    "stale" styling (that word is reserved for "this data is old" -
    see _is_stale() elsewhere on this page):
      - matched: a real reverse row was found at collection time -
        green/up-styled, names the far end.
      - one-sided: no reverse row was found (far site not yet
        collected, or the tunnel really was removed on that end) -
        warn-styled, surfaced rather than hidden (see match_tunnels()'s
        own docstring for why this is deliberate, not a bug).
      - unparsed: this interface's 'Tunnel source ..., destination ...'
        line didn't parse at all, so match_tunnels() had nothing to
        even attempt a match with - dim/neutral styled, distinct from
        "one-sided" since there's no meaningful source/destination to
        report here at all, not just a missing far end.
    Interface up/down status gets its own separate badge, independent
    of match state - a matched tunnel can still be administratively
    down, and that's worth seeing at a glance too.

    arrange_isolated() and site_map_svg.render_svg() need: which real
    sites have qualifying inter-site connections, the deduplicated edge
    list, and per-site display metadata.

    Tunnel-only edges (CDP-derived cross-site links deliberately left
    out - see below). Deduplicated by the actual DEVICE pair (not just
    the site pair) before being aggregated into a site-pair count - a
    physical tunnel recorded from BOTH ends' own scans (once each site
    has scanned the other) is the same real connection, not two.
    Matched tunnel_links rows (device_b_id set) whose two devices
    belong to different real sites become an edge. A ONE-SIDED tunnel
    (device_b_id NULL - see match_tunnels()'s own docstring) has no
    known far end to draw an edge to, so it's counted per origin site
    instead and surfaced as a marker on that site's own node, not as a
    dangling edge.

    CDP cross-site links are NOT drawn here (deliberately dropped,
    per Cadence - this map only ever shows one node per SITE, and a
    CDP link is a specific DEVICE-to-DEVICE cable; on a site-level map
    that just reads as a same-strength edge between two sites that
    might have one link or forty, without ever showing the thing that
    would actually explain it - the individual devices and cabling.
    That's exactly what the per-site topology diagrams already show.
    Tunnels are different: a GRE tunnel genuinely IS a site-to-site
    concept (it's how one whole site reaches another over the WAN), so
    it belongs on a site-level map in a way a CDP cable between two
    specific switches doesn't).

    Includes model (from phone_enrichment, if any) alongside type, so

    search result row is already a link to its own site page, so
