"""
write_queue.py - shared, durable write queue for SAD.

Problem this solves: sad.db lives on a network share, and multiple
gui.py processes plus a multithreaded discovery scan's many worker
threads all want to write to it at once. SQLite's own file locking
over SMB is slow/unreliable for anything beyond "one writer, briefly" -
a long write, or several concurrent short ones, locks everyone else
out of the live file for its whole duration.

Instead of writing to sad.db directly, a write goes through
queue_write() here, which drops a small durable JSON file describing
the intended operation into a shared spool directory next to sad.db.
Actually applying queued items to the live database is try_drain()'s
job - exactly one caller does that at a time (enforced by a simple
claim-a-lock-file protocol), turning "many writers fighting over the
live file" into "many writers appending to a directory (safe, no
coordination needed) + one drainer applying a backlog in small,
fast, individually-committed steps".

Every operation queued here is expected to be idempotent and
resolvable by real-world key (site octet, hostname, device-pair, etc)
- not a raw SQL diff - matching how db.py's upsert-style functions
already work. That's what makes replay order mostly not matter and
makes a half-finished drain (crash mid-loop) safe to just resume
later: nothing here pre-assigns a row id, so there's no possibility
of a primary-key collision the way there would be if two independent
copies of the database were merged back together instead.

There is deliberately no always-on process reading this queue. Every
gui.py instance is a potential drainer: an action queues its own
write and then immediately tries to drain the whole queue itself
(queue_and_apply(), the common case - a single user working alone
sees no lag at all), and gui.py also runs a periodic background drain
on a timer so an idle-but-open GUI keeps the queue moving even when
nobody's actively clicking anything. If literally no GUI is open,
queued items just wait safely on disk until the next one is.

    sub-operations as ONE spool item and blocks until the whole batch
    has been applied as a single connection/commit, returning the list
    of each sub-op's own result in the same order `ops` was given.

    `ops` is a list of {"action": <ACTIONS name>, "kwargs": {...}}
    dicts - each one exactly what you'd otherwise pass to
    queue_and_wait() individually. Use this instead of calling
    queue_and_wait() once per sub-op whenever a whole set of writes
    naturally belongs to one step (a site's full ARP pull, a full MAC
    correlation pass, or - for CDP - one neighbor's device/IP/link
    writes) and doesn't need any other write to be visible in between.

    Raises ValueError up front (before queuing anything) if any op
    names an unknown action, so a typo fails fast instead of silently
    losing part of a batch at drain time. Raises RuntimeError if the
    batch was applied but failed (same meaning as queue_and_wait():
    the whole batch failed together and nothing in it was committed),
    or TimeoutError under the same conditions queue_and_wait() would.
