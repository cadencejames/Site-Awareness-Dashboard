"""
orchestrator.py - Top-level entry point for Site Awareness Dashboard
data collection. Two actions are available per site:

    cdp - walk CDP outward from the site's seed device, writing
          discovered devices/links into the DB as source='cdp'
    arp - connect to the site's ARP seed device, discover any VRFs,
          and pull the global + per-VRF ARP tables into arp_entries

Usage (CLI - runs immediately, no prompts beyond the credential
password):
    python3 orchestrator.py --site <octet|name|code> --action cdp
    python3 orchestrator.py --all --action arp
    python3 orchestrator.py --site <key> --action all

Usage (interactive menu - just run with no arguments):
    python3 orchestrator.py

IMPORTANT: run this from the project root, not from inside utilities/.
sad.db's path is relative to the current working directory, and all
the utilities/ scripts are meant to be run from the root the same
way (e.g. `python3 utilities/inventory_import.py file.csv`) - staying
consistent about that keeps everything pointed at the same database
file.

Requires a credential store to already exist (via
utilities/credential_manager.py) with a 'tacacs' credential (username
+ password) set up.

    progress_cb: optional (event, site_octet, message) callback - see

    print()-based console output (which stays exactly as it was); this
    is a structured, per-site channel a GUI can use to show live status
    without having to parse the interleaved console text of several
    concurrently-running sites.

    No `conn` parameter: this may run concurrently with other sites'
    own discover_site() calls, each in its own worker thread (see
    run_for_sites()), so there's no single shared connection/
    transaction to hand around. Every read below opens its own
    short-lived db.get_conn() - safe to do concurrently, since SQLite
    allows any number of simultaneous readers, only writers contend.
    Every write goes through write_queue.queue_and_wait() (or
    queue_batch_and_wait() for a group of writes with no read-after-
    write dependency between them - see the neighbor loop below),
    which durably queues it (safe against other GUIs/scans writing to
    the same network-shared sad.db at the same time) and blocks THIS
    thread until it's actually been applied, handing back the
    underlying db.py call's result (e.g. a device's row id) - the BFS
    walk below needs that result immediately to keep walking
    correctly.

    connect_fn(ip, username, password) -> raw output string, raising on
    failure. Defaults to the real fetch_cdp_output (live Netmiko). Tests
    pass a fake connect_fn to exercise the walk logic without a real
    connection.

    collect_mac_tables (default False - opt-in): when True, also pulls
    'show mac address-table' from every device reached, on the SAME
    connection CDP already opened (via open_session_fn - the same
    session helper collect_arp() uses - rather than a second
    independent SSH connection per device). The raw output is only
    staged (see db.stage_mac_table_raw()), not yet correlated into the
    clients table - deciding which MAC-table entries are real edge/
    client ports versus inter-switch uplinks needs this site's full
    links table to be complete, which it isn't yet mid-walk. When this
    is False (the default), connect_fn's existing one-shot behavior is
    completely unchanged - this option adds a new, separate code path
    rather than altering the existing one, so a plain CDP walk carries
    none of the extra cost or risk of the heavier MAC-table pull.

    IP selection: instead of a hardcoded mgmt_ip/entry_ip pair, this
    pulls each device's full ranked IP history via db.get_ips_for_device()
    at the moment of connecting (not when it's first queued) - so it
    always reflects everything known so far, including whatever an
    inventory sync already established. inventory_sync-sourced IPs
    outrank cdp-sourced ones automatically; this function doesn't need
    to know or care which source contributed which address.

    Cross-site neighbors: a neighbor's IP is checked against
    db.resolve_site_key_for_ip() only as an initial signal that
    something might be off (its octet doesn't match the site being
    scanned). Once that signal fires, the octet itself is NOT trusted
    to say which site it actually is - that's unreliable for anything
    reached over a non-conforming address (e.g. a WAN-facing IP, which
    doesn't follow the normal per-site addressing scheme at all).
    Instead, the neighbor's hostname is checked against every device
    already known anywhere in the database:
      - a unique match elsewhere -> that's authoritative; the device/
        link get filed under its real, existing site
      - no match anywhere, or an ambiguous multi-site match -> filed
        under the reserved "Unassigned" site for manual review, rather
        than guessing
    Either way the walk does NOT traverse into that neighbor - its own
    site's discovery run (once known) is what should walk outward from
    there.

    genuine edge/client ports versus inter-switch uplinks - a port
    that's also a known link is just a connection to another switch,
    not a real client. Only genuine edge entries get written into the
    clients table; uplink entries are simply skipped (nothing wrong
    with them, they're just not client data).

    Run this ONCE, after a site's full CDP walk (with
    collect_mac_tables=True) has finished - not mid-walk. This needs
    the site's links table to be COMPLETE to correctly recognize every
    uplink; running it against a partial walk could misclassify a
    real uplink as an edge port simply because that particular link
    hadn't been discovered yet at the point of checking.

    Interface names are compared via _normalize_interface() rather
    than as raw strings, since CDP and "show mac address-table"
    frequently report the same physical port in different forms
    (GigabitEthernet1/0/1 vs Gi1/0/1) - a plain string comparison

    No `conn` parameter: sites run concurrently, each in its own worker
    thread, so there's no single shared connection to hand around -
    every read/write below (in discover_site()/collect_arp()/
    correlate_mac_tables()) manages its own, short-lived or queued. The
    only resource shared across worker threads is the write queue
    itself, which is explicitly designed for many concurrent writers
    (see write_queue.py's module docstring) - no scan ever holds a
    connection open long enough to lock another GUI or scan out.

    A per-site failure (a device unreachable, a parsing error, etc.)
    is caught here and printed rather than aborting the whole run, the
    same way discover_site()/collect_arp() already catch their own
    per-device connection failures internally and move on - one bad
    site shouldn't cost every other site its results.

    collect_mac_tables (default False - opt-in): only meaningful
    alongside 'cdp' - see discover_site()'s own docstring for what
    this actually does during the walk. correlate_mac_tables() runs
    right after that SAME site's own CDP walk finishes (not interleaved
    with any other site's walk), since it needs that site's links table
    to be complete first - safe under concurrency because each site's
    links only ever come from that site's own walk.

    progress_cb: optional (event, site_octet, slot, phase, message)
    callback - see _report_progress()'s docstring for the full contract.
    Passed straight through to every site's discover_site()/
    collect_arp()/correlate_mac_tables() calls for "status" updates,

    when a plugin should be standalone rather than per-device).

    Unlike run_plugin(), there is no per-device loop or per-device
    error isolation at the harness level here - the plugin's own
    internal error handling is all there is, since the harness has no
    visibility into what devices it's even touching. Still writes the
    same kind of persistent, timestamped audit log as run_plugin(),
    and the plugin receives the same log() callable to write into it.

    IMPORTANT: unlike a per-device plugin's plan()/apply split (which
    the harness itself enforces - plan() is contractually read-only,
    and only the harness ever calls send_config_set()), a standalone
    plugin's run() function does EVERYTHING, including deciding
    whether to actually apply anything. The harness cannot structurally
    guarantee dry-run safety here - it depends entirely on the plugin
    correctly honoring commit=False itself. See the plugins README.
